    " A class is a blueprint or template used to define the structure and behavior of objects. It encapsulates all the properties (attributes) and functions (methods) that the objects derived from it will have. For example, in the case of a car, the class defines how the car looks, what it can do, and its characteristics like color, speed, and fuel capacity."
